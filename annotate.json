  "title": "A Wedding Toast to Remember",
  "content": "So there I was, at my best friend's wedding, the best man with a speech that was supposed to be heartfelt yet humorous. I had rehearsed it multiple times, and all was going well until I decided to go off-script. You see, the bride, let's call her Sarah, and I had a bit of a history. We dated for a few months in college before she met my buddy, Mark. It was ancient history, but a few drinks in, I thought it would be hilarious to bring it up, joking about how Mark had 'won' Sarah from me. The laughter in the room was awkward at best, and at worst, downright silent. Sarah's family glared daggers at me, while Mark tried to force a smile. After realizing my colossal mistake, I tried to salvage the speech by pivoting to how wonderful they were together, but the damage was done. Sarah wouldn't make eye contact, and the atmosphere remained chilly for the rest of the night. Mark hasn’t spoken to me since. In the moment, I thought it was just a light-hearted joke, but now I am second-guessing everything. Was bringing up my past relationship with Sarah during the toast an honest mistake, or did I cross a line that can’t be uncrossed? I genuinely care about my friendship with Mark, but I can't help but wonder if I'm the one at fault here.",
